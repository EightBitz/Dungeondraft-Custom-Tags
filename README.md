# EightBitz's Custom Tags Tool

What follows is a brief description of what this is and what it does, but please read [the full documentation](https://github.com/EightBitz/Dungeondraft-Custom-Tags/blob/Version-0.6/EightBitz's%20Custom%20Tags%20Documentation.pdf) as it contains important details.

## Getting Started

To use this program, download the following files from this repository and put them all in the same folder.

* [CustomTags.exe](https://github.com/EightBitz/Dungeondraft-Custom-Tags/blob/Version-0.7/CustomTags.exe)
* [Newtonsoft.Json.dll](https://github.com/EightBitz/Dungeondraft-Custom-Tags/blob/Version-0.7/Newtonsoft.Json.dll)

## What Does it Do?

This program offers you a point-and-click interface to create/modify your own, customized default.dungeondraft_tags files for your own, custom asset packs. You do the pointing and clicking, and the program generates a valid JSON file that matches your selections.

## Credits

Huge thanks to Noral Kuhlmann (NoralKu on the Megasploot Discord server) for getting thumbnails to work. The code I had in place was sluggish and buggy, but Noral made it work like a pro.

He also found and fixed a few other miscellaneous things in the code.

Thanks, Noral!
