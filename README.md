## What Does it Do?

This program offers you a point-and-click interface to create/modify your own, customized default.dungeondraft_tags files for your own, custom asset packs. You do the pointing and clicking, and the program generates a valid JSON file that matches your selections.

## Credits

**NoralKu:** Huge thanks to Noral Kuhlmann (NoralKu on the Megasploot Discord server) for getting thumbnails to work. The code I had in place was sluggish and buggy, but Noral made it work like a pro.

He also found and fixed a few other miscellaneous things in the code, and he helped with the composition of the About form and the new splash screen.

**Nexoness:** Thanks to Nexoness on Discord for the new logo.
